[Codecast: Supporting Data Driven In-Network Processing for Low-Power Wireless Sensor Networks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8480037)

Codecast is a many-to-many communication protocol which is based on [Chaos](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2517351.2517358?casa_token=2snpIVkC5FkAAAAA:IFNpBYaP4iW0VFc00Z_Tp9J3vZHC91oXrwBz7LQdQ6qBW94Xxta9tMCia-OmBkYUyiCtOVQXg3_5Ca4).

## Running an example on Cooja
You may directly open the given simulation file ["30_nodes_demo"](https://github.com/ebramkw/codecast/blob/main/contiki/apps/codecast-test/30_nodes_demo.csc).
In this example, 30 nodes are sharing a 100 bytes payload in a many-to-many fashion.

## Running on a testbed
You may update the nodes settings under [deploy](https://github.com/ebramkw/codecast/tree/main/contiki/core/deploy).
